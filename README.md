# Vulnerability Management

## Scenario

You recently accepted a position with Power Pulse Utilities, a local electricity distribution company for the town in which you live. Power Pulse serves 30,000 people and includes a mix of residential, commercial, and light industrial electricity demands. Power Pulse employs 40 people, has a head office and they also operate 3 distribution stations.
As Power Pulse is a small electricity distribution organization, everyone in the organization serves many roles. You are hired as an IT analyst, but you are expected to help with all aspects of IT including performing cyber security duties such as analyzing vulnerability scanning results.

A couple of weeks before you joined Power Pulse, Karen, the head of IT, hired a third-party consulting company to conduct a vulnerability scan of Power Pulse’s assets on both their IT and OT networks. As your first major assignment with PowerPulse, she provides you with the scan results that the third party provided and has asked you to create a Vulnerability Assessment Report.

### Background Information

#### 1. Zoom Clients for Windows Desktop

This software is installed on all 40 Windows desktops and laptops that are used by Power Pulse employees. She also lets you know that these laptops contain confidential information about Power Pulse’s operations and also some may contain confidential client information

#### 2. Siemens Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) 

The 6 Siemens Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) that appear on the report are located at Power Pulse’s 3 distribution stations. She lets you know that these stations are each protected by a firewall, so all traffic traveling to the station across Power Pulse’s wide area networks needs to pass through a firewall located at each station. Therefore an attacker would need to get onto the local network to exploit devices located in the 3 stations. She also indicates that Internet access is not available from the station networks.

#### 3. Cisco

The Cisco vulnerability that appears on the report impacts 35 SIP phones (model 3905) that are all located at Power Pulse’s head office. She indicates that these devices are considered of low importance from a confidentiality, integrity, and availability perspective, as they aren’t used that often since most employees use their corporate cell phones or the Zoom client on their computers to call colleagues. All calls from clients are routed to a separate call center operated by a third-party organization.

### What I did?

I analyzed vulnerability scanner output and conducted further research to understand the following:
