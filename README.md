## Scenario

You recently accepted a position with Power Pulse Utilities, a local electricity distribution company for the town in which you live. Power Pulse serves 30,000 people and includes a mix of residential, commercial, and light industrial electricity demands. Power Pulse employs 40 people, has a head office and they also operate 3 distribution stations.
As Power Pulse is a small electricity distribution organization, everyone in the organization serves many roles. You are hired as an IT analyst, but you are expected to help with all aspects of IT including performing cyber security duties such as analyzing vulnerability scanning results.

A couple of weeks before you joined Power Pulse, Karen, the head of IT, hired a third-party consulting company to conduct a vulnerability scan of Power Pulseâ€™s assets on both their IT and OT networks. As your first major assignment with PowerPulse, she provides you with the scan results that the third party provided and has asked you to create a Vulnerability Assessment Report.
